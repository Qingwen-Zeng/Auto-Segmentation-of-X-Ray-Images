# Auto-Segmentation-of-X-Ray-Images
The primary objective of this project is the development and training of a deep neural network, based on existing architectures, commonly used for other computer vision tasks (e.g. UNet, VGGnet, etc.) The training dataset consists of real-world X-ray images (raw and segmented), and the results will be benchmarked against manually labeled datasets.
